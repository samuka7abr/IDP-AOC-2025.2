## EXERCISES

## EX1
```
if(i == j) f = g + h;
else f = g - h;
```

## EX2
```
while(i < 10)
    i++;
```

## EX3
- given signed number in t0, find the minimal number of instructions to:
    - jump to neg if is negative
    - jump to zero if is zero
    - jump to pos if is positive


## CHALLENGE 1
- write a program that checks wether an index i is within the bounds [0, n) using only one branch instruction, adding 10 in t2 if it is and 5 if not


## CHALLENGE 2
- find the median of 3 numbers using only conditional and unconditional branches EXERCISES
